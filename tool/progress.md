# Object files
Generated by the Make file on the repository, tried to keep the same compilation flags but some were giving error. Check the keil flangs and make file to determine the missing.

**startup_SSE310MPS3.c file is modified as *__set_MSPLIM* and *__set_PSPLIM* function were not recognized during compilation**



# Linking Object files:
1. Relace object files in Keil IDE with generated file from the previous step. **Could not find any command line option or linking option in Keil**

2. Link with gcc tool chain provided by ARM. Curretly getting errors of undefined reference. For linking stage also not all linker flags are included because of error. **Current command after running Make file:** ../../m85-toolchain/arm-gnu-toolchain-12.2.mpacbti-bet1-x86_64-arm-none-eabi/bin/arm-none-eabi-gcc -march=armv8.1-m.main+pacbti -mcpu=Cortex-M85 -mfpu=fpv5-d16 *.o -callgraph -o Blinky.axf -T linker_SSE310MPS3_secure.ld
